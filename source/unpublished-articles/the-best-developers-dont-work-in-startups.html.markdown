Last week I read [an article from Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/strong-opinions-weakly-held.html) where he addresses some criticism or other from one of his readers. Honestly the article wasn't that memorable, but what *did* draw my attention was an example slide he linked to (hit the article above if you want to see the original) which said:

> What have I really done?

>> Don't own a company.
>> Didn't participate in an important startup.
>> Didn't author a framework or standard.
>> Haven't made a lot of money.
>>                             NOTHING

What bothered me about this slide was the truth in it: most of us are looking for **technical** bona fides in the form of entrepreneurial or financial success. It's the tech industry's version of celebrity worship, and it encourages a shallow, unhealthy viewpoint of engineering talent.

## Big fish, little pond
Are engineers in startups talented? Of course, there is plenty of talent, but there is definitely not *more* talent, or even *better* talent, so why such a disproportionate representation? The size of the engineering challenges at **many** startups is laughable. Most ideas die long before they reach scale, and the current startup culture is to [fail early and fail often](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/110586/the-downside-the-startup-failure-craze). The kind of engineer likely to succeed in this environment is very good at building something fast and lean. Admirable skills to be sure, but they're only part of the story when I'm looking to hire *a great engineer*. 

[Web services](aws.amazon.com "aws.amazon.com") are lowering the technical bar further, which is *great if you're trying to start a business*, but terrible if you're looking to challenge top engineering talent. Many of the hard engineering problems are being solved for you, and there is even less reason for your engineering talent to be "rock star quality" when getting an idea off the ground. The fact that an engineer's resume has half a dozen failed startup ideas in the past 23 months is becoming less and less meaningful as I consider you for my project...

## So what, why does it matter that we idolize startup culture? What's the harm in that?

There are two issues that I see as a negative outcomes of over-indexing on startups:
1. encourages talented engineers to work on problems that are below them.
2. It de-emphasizes really awesome technical contributions so that we can talk more about cell phone social dating apps.

Let's not fool ourselves, recognition and peer acceptance are important to even the most egalitarian among us. When a talented engineer starts her career, we want her to work on important problems, big problems, stuff that moves the ball forward for everyone. If the tech industry only pays attention to startup culture, then we skew thinking in that direction to an unhealthy degree. If the only way to get people to recognize your contribution is to say you worked at a startup, then we close the door to a lot of really hard problems that exist outside of that echo chamber.

It also sucks if you're the engineer who's done really truly amazing things at a larger company. These anonymous contributors deserve recognition for taking what may have been a good startup idea and delivering to a massive audience. Too much credit is given to the engineer that built version 0, and not the version that actually scaled to the needs of millions of people. From the perspective of **technical** achievement, the latter is a much more impressive outcome. If we're going to build up idols for the next generation of engineers to follow, let's make sure we don't forget about people who actually delivered awesome technical achievements.

## Why **do** we over-emphasize startup contributions?

This problem isn't simply a result of the tech industry liking the next shiny new object, although we certainly do. Here are 3 sources that I see as being big contributors: 
1. **Startups are relentless promotion machines, and they're good at it.** Startups survive on the attention and buzz they get, and they know that. A large portion of their time and energy is spent on self promotion, which means they're extremely motivated to get their people out and noticed. "What's that? You want to go talk about how OUR company uses Ruby on Rails to a bunch of other engineers at a conference? ABSOLUTELY GO DO THAT RIGHT NOW" Trying to get noticed certainly helps in getting people to pay attention to you.

2. **Large and medium sized companies do a terrible job of promoting their engineering talent.** Quick quiz: what's one of the most performance intensive technical applications in the world? I'm sure you guessed that it's [high frequency trading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading "High frequency trading"). An absolutely stunning abuse of technology, but one that requires some truly great engineering minds. Now quickly, name one of the wizards behind HFT systems. Yeah me either. Large companies have less of a reason to promote their talent, and in the ultra competitive world of recruiting, many will view it as counter-productive. That of course is a very short-sited view, but we can talk about that another time. 

3. **Media outlets don't have any reason to emphasize balanced coverage of small and large players.** Startups are sexy! They're high energy, and it's where the magic is happening! Look at this one, their employees sit on big yoga balls! **W0w** It's easier to pontificate about the amazing things a new company is doing because nobody else is talking about it. Also, see #1, startups are happy to talk to media about what they're doing, larger businesses... not so much. You're favorite "industry website" is going to have an easier time covering startups, and the people who workt there, and so they do. 

## Please don't read this and think that I don't think entrepreneurship is important

I'm making a broad generalization of a very diverse industry. There is amazing talent working on meaningful and difficult technical problems in the startup industry, but it isn't [manifest destiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny "Manifest destiny") that you should be listened to, simply because your company's idea got VC funding, or has a really slick phone app. VC's don't fund the most technically significant work they fund the work most likely to be profitable (maybe, we hope...). You know who deserves praise at a startup? The founder, and first tier of management. These are the people who deserve credit for executing on a great idea, building the right culture for long term success, honing down the product into something that can be delivered quickly with enough value to be useful, etc...

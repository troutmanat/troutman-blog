If you've been in the software industry for a while, I advice you to go check out [reddit's CS Career questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/ "/r/cscareerquestions") it's a good reminder about what it's like to actually be in college, or on the cusp of starting a career. It's an uncertain time to say the least. I see a ton of repeated themes here, so let's take a look at some common themes and I'll give you my 2 cents worth. 

## I'm struggling in my CS degree, should I stick it out?
If you're struggling because it doesn't hold your interest and you're not doing the work, then get out of the major. This is more about happiness than it is a statement of whether or not you'll be successful. Don't set yourself up for an unfulfilling career in your early 20s. It's easy to endure something for the last 5 years of your career, but not the next 40, you're setting yourself up for failure.

If there are a couple classes that you just don't "get" then don't beat yourself up over it, take the approach that you'll need to perservere. Some people excel at the theoretical, some are great software craftsmen, and some are both. Some people are too busy having fun in their undergradute careers, and their grades show it. I can speak from experience here: I had pretty poor grades in college, but I stuck it out because the subject matter was interesting to me, and I wanted to continue. I went on to get great grades in a smaller masters program, and ultimately ended up in a great job. If you like the subject matter but find it difficult, stick it out. 

## I didn't go to college out of highschool, I need to make more money, what should I do?

## Should I major in ultra-specific sub-dicipline #1, or #2?
Meh, probably doesn't matter. Many students incorrectly assume that their specialization in college will pre-determine the entire trajectory of their career, which isn't true at all. Even if you're going to persue an academic career, the undergraduate education isn't going to pidgeon hole you into a particular field of study. Why do I say this?

1. You're area of focus in college is merely a "oh that's nice" on your resume. I don't trust you (yet) to write something critical just because you took some extra courses on it in college. I'm going to give you general roblems and let you show me that you're better than this. 
2. If I'm looking for someone with specific skills in a partucular area, I'm looking for a person with a track record, which means experience successfuly delivering. That isn't you, at least not yet. 

## I'm all out of passion at 24, what should I do?
Two possible scenarios here:
1. 

## I want to rejoin the industry, but I've got a gap, what do I do/put on my resume?
On your resume, push your applicable skills to the top, and your work experience down. You don't need to explain on the resume. If you're skills look good, then

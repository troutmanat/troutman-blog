## Retention problems
A wizened manager once gave me some good advice: *You either have a talent acquisition problem, or you have a retention problem*. Let's say fortune has smiled upon you, and you've hired some [really great engineers](/articles/2013/01/24/rockstar-programmers-are-not-assholes.html) for your team. Now you have to figure out manage your best talent, so they don't become your former talent. 

## Keep your best people as busy as possible
The best way to manage a top performer is to give them a lot of work and responsibility. Seriously, I mean *a lot* - up to [10 times what you'd give your bottom performer](http://blogs.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2008/03/27/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-quot-10x-quot.aspx "10x Software Development"). Give them projects you wouldn't have taken on as an engineer. Give them big outcomes to own, things they can't accomplish on their own. Tell them they've got to not only be personally productive, but they need to make the team productive as well. Keep piling it on and see when they saturate, if this is your first time managing a top performer it's going to surprise you.

Why put so much on them? Because you owe them that. You are literally wasting their time and talent by giving them the same amount of work and expectations you would your average engineer. They are by definition not average, giving them average expectations will **make them bored and unsatisfied**.

## Here comes Maslow
So why doesn't your top talent rage quit under so much work and responsibility? The answer is that all this extra expectation is fulfilling a need. In the 1940's a psychologist named Abraham Maslow (It's always the Abrahams...) decided to focus on the most mentally well equipped, rather than the least, to see what makes them tick. He ended up with a food pyramid of needs he brilliantly called [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). While modern psychology disagrees with the strict stack ranking, most feel that he pretty much nailed it when it comes to what drives people. 

Now if you take a look at the pyramid, it becomes obvious: people want to achieve things, they want respect of their peers, they want to solve problems, and they want to poop. You can help people fulfill many of those needs simply by giving them meaningful work that they can succeed at. Again, you owe it to your best people (all people really) to give them meaningful things to achieve. 

## How you can still manage to screw this up
Setting high expectations isn't your only role in their success. You'll hear managers say "I set expectations and then just get out of the way", which sounds very enlightened of them, but can quickly turn into an absentee manager. When you hear the phrase *get out of the way*, it's best to mentally replace it with *don't micro-manage their every decision*. You can't mentally check out and expect the right thing to happen just because someone is talented. You'll be asking them to do thing they've never done before, so be a resource for them. Remember that their needs are only met if they actually end up succeeding some of the time. Ask them to explain their plan, get them to use you as a sounding board. Resist the temptation to disagree unless their plan is clearly egregious. Instead, formulate your concerns in the form of questions for them to think about: "How do you plan to get Sally's team to help out? They're focused on the new Sheriff badge project this month". They might surprise you with an answer you didn't think of.

Ask them to do a ton, but make sure you clearly set priorities for them. Don't be afraid to put dates to the most important stuff. Output, even for top performers, ebbs and flows .You need to keep a healthy backlog of work in front of them in case you're not around when the flow happens. By the same token, you shouldn't make them play "guess what I care about today" because nobody likes that game and the rules are setup so assholes always win.

Finally, you have to pay really close attention to signs of burnout. Make sure your best people aren't pushing aside life solely for work, that's a great short term gain for you as a manager, but it's cruel, and pretty much guarantees that they'll walk away and never work for you again. If you want your career to be no more than 3 years long, then maybe go for it. The fact is, while the empirical evidence is spotty for why people leave a position, the reality on the ground is obvious: their manager created a toxic environment, they were bored out of their mind, they had a big change in their life. As a manager you own solving 2 of those 3 problems...

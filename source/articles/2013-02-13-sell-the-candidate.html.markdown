Hiring talent is the most time consuming aspect of my job. If you plot effort vs reward, it's the outlier in the upper right corner. It's incredibly important to [get the right people along for the ride](/articles/2013/01/31/conference-cycle-management.html "Conference Cycle Management"), which often requires convincing.

A very small portion of candidates will get to the point where you're interested in hiring them. Most will not get their resume in front of you, a good portion will never make it past the initial phone interview, and then finally another group will stumble during on-site interviews. If a candidate has made it this far, then your team has literally spent **hours** working to hire them. *The absolute worst time to loose a candidate is when you're making them an offer*. You have to get this part of the process right, or you're going to waste a lot of your team's time and effort. Wasting your team's time also costs you respect, which is just about the hardest thing to get back ever. You need to figure out how to get the right people on board, or you'll never have the critical mass of talent required for success.

## The Sell Call

So your team has convened and everyone is extremely excited about the new candidate. The next step will be calling to tell the candidate that you're going to make them an offer. In most situations, they'll want to talk to you (the hiring manager) about the position. Because you hire the best, and because this person is good enough to work with you, they're also good enough to work anywhere else. They have options, so now it's time to sell the candidate on the position. Here's how. 

## Let's start with what not to talk about

* **Yourself** - Nobody is joining a company just so they can work for you. Focus on the candidate and leave your own ego behind. 
* **Gimmicks or standard benefits** - If your strategy involves talking about silly perks, or telling them that every new hire gets a free t-shirt you're doomed. Sure, benefits are important, but that's not what makes your position important. Why don't I go work somewhere else in your company? Why don't I go work for Google? Your company is not your team. Good candidates are looking for a purpose, and free lunch isn't it.
* **The technology** - Wait, Enterprise Java Beans aren't the hot new technology? It's not 1994 anymore? Again, great candidates might have a preferred language, but [beware the developer who will only work in the latest technology](/articles/2013/01/24/rockstar-programmers-are-not-assholes.html). What you're doing with the tech is much more important than what the tech is. 

## What to talk about: Purpose and Opportunity

In your sell call, you need to convey what the purpose of your team is, why it's important, and what the opportunity will be for joining **now**. Here's some things to consider as you're laying it out for them:

* **No bullshit** - Be direct and to the point. Don't come across like a used car salesman desperate to land the candidate. Unless of course you sell used cars... then...er... maybe?
* **One sentence purpose** - Why does your team exist? "We put the herp in the herp-a-derp." Or whatever. Just make sure you're answer isn't muddled, or sounds like "we do a bunch of stuff that nobody else wanted to deal with!". If the candidate asks a friend to help them decide on several positions, this single sentence is likely what they'll regurgitate back to them. Make sure it's meaningful.
* **Describe success** - You need to be able to show the candidate where the team is heading in the next few years. Are you fixing a big problem? Launching a new product? Trying something experimental and new? If you're having trouble putting your work into this context, then maybe *you* should be looking for a new job. You've got to sell the vision of future success. 
* **Talk about the customer** - Despite all evidence to the contrary, most people like the idea of helping others. Show them who's going to benefit from the work they do. Talk about how happy and appreciative they'll be making someone.
* **Show them they're needed** - If you've done a good job talking about what your team does, showing that your best work is yet to be done, and giving them someone to help, you're practically done. The last step is to show them that there's a gap in the lineup without them. They've gone through a tough interview process by this point, so give a little back. Tell them that you're excited, tell them that they'd be a great fit. Make them feel that all this great stuff isn't going to work without their help. That isn't a lie.

## Create Urgency to close the deal
I'll leave you with two great stories that I think really exemplify the importance of creating a sense of urgency. Steve Job's [Do you really want to sell sugar water, or do you want to come with me and change the world?](http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2011/09/scully-on-jobs-sugar-water-legend.html), and Eric Schmidt's ["Get on a rocket ship."](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/05/24/sheryl-sandberg-to-harvard-biz-grads-find-a-rocket-ship/). 

If you can't make the candidate feel like they're getting on a rocket ship with you, or you don't believe that yourself, then what are you doing? There are plenty of opportunities, let me sell you on one of them...

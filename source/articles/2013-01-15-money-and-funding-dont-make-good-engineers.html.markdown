I read [an article from Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/strong-opinions-weakly-held.html) recently and an opening slide he used caught my eye. It read:

> What have I really done?

>> Don't own a company.
>> Didn't participate in an important startup.
>> Didn't author a framework or standard.
>> Haven't made a lot of money.
>>                             NOTHING

What bothered me about this slide was the truth in it: most of us are looking for **technical** bona fides in the form of entrepreneurial or financial success. It's the tech industry's version of celebrity worship, and it encourages a shallow, unhealthy viewpoint of engineering talent.

## Big fish, little pond
Are engineers in startups talented? Of course, there is plenty of talent, but there is definitely not *more* talent, or even *better* talent, so why is financial or entrepreneurial success a technical qualification? The size of the engineering challenge at **many** startups is laughable. Most ideas die long before they reach scale, and the current culture is to [fail early and fail often](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/110586/the-downside-the-startup-failure-craze). What kind of engineer does that culture encourage? 

* good at building something fast
* keeps things lean, builds for today and not tomorrow

Admirable skills to be sure, but they're only part of the story if I'm looking to hire *a great engineer*. 

[Web services](aws.amazon.com "aws.amazon.com") lower the technical bar further, which is great if you're trying to start a business, but doesn't give much authority to the engineering talent of a startup. Many hard engineering problems are being solved for you, and so there is even less reason for engineering talent to be "rock star quality" when getting an idea off the ground. It should also be obvious that owning a company, and being a great engineer are likely to have nothing to do with one another. So again, why are these the people we put in a place of authority?

## So what, why does it matter that we idolize startup culture? What's the harm in that?

There are two issues that I see as a negative outcome of over-indexing on startups:
1. encourages talented engineers to work on problems that are below them
2. de-emphasizes really awesome technical contributions so that we can talk more about cell phone social dating apps

Recognition and peer acceptance are important to even the most humble among us. When a talented engineer starts her career, I want her to work on important problems, big problems, stuff that moves the ball forward for everyone. If the tech industry only idolizes CEOs and startup culture, then we skew thinking in that direction to an unhealthy degree. If the only way people recognize your contribution is to say you worked at a startup, then we close the door to a lot of really hard problems that exist outside of that echo chamber.

It also sucks if you're the engineer who's done really truly amazing things at a larger company. Large tech companies have larger problems, and their engineer talent deserves recognition. Too much credit is given to the engineer that built version 0, and not the version that actually scaled to the needs of millions of people. From the perspective of **technical** achievement, the latter is a much more impressive outcome. If we're going to build up idols for the next generation of engineers to follow, let's make sure we don't forget about the people who delivered in a big way.

## Why **do** we over-emphasize startup contributions?

This problem isn't simply a result of the tech industry liking the next shiny new object, although we certainly do. Here are 3 contributors: 

1. **Startups are relentless promotion machines, and they're good at it.** Startups survive on the attention and buzz they get, and they know that. A large portion of their time and energy is spent on self promotion, which means they're extremely motivated to get their people out and noticed. "What's that? You want to go talk about how OUR company uses Ruby on Rails to a bunch of other engineers at a conference? ABSOLUTELY GO DO THAT RIGHT NOW" Trying to get noticed certainly helps in getting people to pay attention to you.
2. **Large and medium sized companies do a terrible job of promoting their engineering talent.** Quick quiz: what's one of the most performance intensive technical applications in the world? I'm sure you guessed that it's [high frequency trading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading "High frequency trading"). An absolutely stunning abuse of technology, but one that requires some truly great engineering minds. Now quickly, name one of the wizards behind HFT systems. Yeah me either. Large companies have less of a reason to promote their talent, and in the ultra competitive world of recruiting, many will view it as counter-productive. That of course is a very short-sited view, but we can talk about that another time. 
3. **Media outlets don't have any reason to emphasize balanced coverage of small and large players.** Startups are sexy! They're high energy, and it's where the magic is happening! Look at this one, their employees sit on big yoga balls! **W0w** It's easier to pontificate about the amazing things a new company is doing because nobody else is talking about it. Also, see #1, startups are happy to talk to media about what they're doing. Larger businesses... not so much. You're favorite "industry website" is going to have an easier time covering startups, and the people who work there, and so they do. 

## Please don't read this and assume that I don't think entrepreneurship is important

I'm making a broad generalization of a very diverse industry. There is amazing talent working on meaningful and difficult technical problems in the startup industry, but it isn't [manifest destiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny "Manifest destiny") that you should be listened to, simply because your company's idea got VC funding, or has a really slick phone app. VC's don't fund the most technically significant work they fund the work most likely to be profitable (maybe, we hope...). The person who deserves praise at a startup is the founder, and first tier of management, but it's frequently not for their technical achievements. These are the people who are executing on a great idea, building the right culture for long term success, honing down the product into something that can be delivered quickly with enough value to be useful, etc... 

The CEO of a successful startup is doing an exceptional job, but that shouldn't translate into me sitting at a conference listening to yet another talk about how his team built their entire infrastructure on mongo and javascript and never looked back. But we've christened this company with some sort of false authority and status because their founder figured out how to turn a profit, and suddenly we're all talking about this whiz bang new architecture like there's no problem it can't solve. Meanwhile, there's a team that's figured out how to coordinate millions of stock purchases a second, in real time, across the globe, and most of us don't even notice. Surely that guy has some good lessons learned for the burgeoning programmer?

## Thinking of the children

As an industry we owe it to ourselves to cultivate the best in all of us, to not give in to false prophets no matter how charismatic or shiny their icons are. Let's all be a little more selective about who we anoint, and who we ignore. Over-emphasis on profits, VC funding, and IPOs as our metric for what makes a great engineer is the equivalent of choosing Honey Boo Boo over Ira Glass. We're wired to pay attention to the sensational, but our more reasonable selves can decide that we're overlooking what's important and expect more from our heroes. We want positive role models for our <strike>children</strike> future engineers. 

If you go back and look at the original slide, there is 1 achievement that I've conveniently ignored, but perhaps gives us hope for the future: "Didn't author a framework or standard.". This, in my mind is an example of a credible engineering deliverable. It's the kind of thing that we measure the quality of, not based on how well it made money or advertised itself, but on how useful it actually is to the developer community. We need more ways to separate technical from executive achievement.

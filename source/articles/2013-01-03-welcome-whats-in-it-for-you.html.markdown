Welcome to Andy Troutman's Blog. We (royal we, there turns out to be only one of me at this point) realize you have many options for spending your time, and want to thank you for selecting us. When I think about your family, job, personal hobbies, daily grooming regiment, caloric requirements, etc... I'm down right surprised that you chose to spend some time with 

OK Is everybody gone now? Just you and I? Good. Let's get down to it shall we?

## What's in it for me if I read this blog?
Unless you're my mom (Hi Mom!) you don't want to spend time reading stories about what I had for breakfast today (coffee, it was coffee). Instead, my hope is to use this blog to talk about subjects that consume a lot of my time: managing people and technical projects. More specifically, the area I'm most involved in is managing large software projects. 

If you follow along, we'll get to talk shop on a variety of topics:
* personal and team productivity
* effectiveness
* conflict resolution
* conflict avoidance
* conflict creation
* agile practices
* software estimation
* systems design
* career management
* career progression
* recruiting
* talent retention and acquisition
* lasers

## Why should I listen to you?
Why should you listen to anyone? You should collect as much data as you can, believe in what's empirical, and then trust in your own self to follow the intangible ideas that resonate with you. I'm going to share what I've learned from working on large software projects, both as an engineer and as a manager. We'll revise as we go along.

## Why are you doing this?
With a few [notable](http://www.randsinrepose.com/ "Rands in repose") exceptions, there aren't enough people talking about how to be a better technical manager, which I think is reflected in the general quality of management as a whole. Having the conversation at least gets the ball rolling. 

When I started my engineering career after college, I had some TERRIBLE managers that caused me to pretty much dismiss the entire job family as useless overhead. I was **radicalized** in my hatred for management, and felt strongly that they added nothing to the process but misery. Then I [switched jobs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/jobs?_ref=career_home) and suddenly worked with a manager that was incredibly awesome. He helped get shit done by finding me resources, providing clarity when things were ambiguous, advocating for the right outcomes, etc... he helped us do our best work, and he made the job better. It completely changed my opinion of managers for the better. Years later, I would finally give in to a growing number of voices telling me "you should try out management". I'm glad I did.

## Alright, let's get going.
You're in a hurry to get started, I like that about you...check out some of the older, long-form writing I've done. Feel free to comment, or if you have something you'd like to discuss, [send me an email](mailto:andy.troutman@gmail.com "andy.troutman@gmail.com") and I'll add it to the discussion queue.

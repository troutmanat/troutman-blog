It's review season once again, and that means a lot of data gathering and reminiscing about a year's worth of effort. Keeping track of your own failures and achievements can be difficult enough, but doing so for a team of 5, 7, 12 is nearly impossible. Still, it's important that as a manger you come up with some way to keep track of the entire review year, or you can end up in a situation where your review reads like a discussion of the last 3 months of the year. That's unfair to your team, and pretty much makes you a bad person, so don't do it. 

## Email as an information repository
Like it or not, you exchange and store a lot of context within your email. Some people have a real problem with email being a long-term storage mechanism, but it's a natural fit:

* it's an automatically digitized transcript of a conversation
* email is usually backed up and protected from loss with no effort on the user's part
* There is a robust tool chain in place for searching, and organizing

Simply put, there isn't any other tool that you can expect every place you ever work for to have, which meets these 3 criteria. Where it all goes wrong is when your **inbox** becomes a single repository of information. It takes less than a month's worth of "manager-level" email before this system becomes completely unsustainable, so you'll need to figure out how you want to store all that amazing context in a hierarchy that makes sense. 

## Where was I? Oh yeah, annual reviews. 
Here is my dead simple system for keeping tabs on my team's accomplishments throughout the year:

1. Create a folder in your email for each of your direct reports. I prefix their name with a * so it sorts to the top of exchange
2. When I get email about something they accomplished, or something they didn't accomplish, or extra effort they performed, I drag the last email in the thread into their name folder
3. During review season, I crack open the folder and refresh my memory

So Simple right? But don't let my nice bulleted list bamboozle you, there are a couple optimizations I would suggest to really make this work for you:

* **Make sure you capture context within the thread.** - It's really easy for an email to make sense in the moment, but maybe not so much 9 months later. If Lisa sends you an email that reads "I've finished up the fix we identified from the ops review" that might make perfect sense in the moment, but will be useless out of context. You can of course provide the context by replying and BCCing yourself: "Thanks Lisa! Really appreciate that you were able to figure out why all the keyboards were exploding in the office, now everyone won't have to program with exploded hands!" Now Lisa has some well deserved positive acknowledgment, and you've captured the context. You're winning the game of managers my friend.
* **Wait for the thread to close out and save the last email** - Sometimes it isn't clear where a thread of conversation is going to head after the first email. Don't jump the gun and drag an email into the folder until it's played itself out. Sometimes Bob will send an email to the whole team to say that he's done with something, and then 3 people will reply and tell Bob that his solution causes cancer, and that everyone hates him now. Better wait for that 2nd email before you go dragging the thread into the job well done bucket. The email becomes your court transcript in some ways... it's a personal stenographer of the events. 
* **Sometimes the email itself is the reason your saving it** - Don't just save emails with outcomes, also save emails that are good and bad examples of communication. Communication is important for anyone who has to work with people, so if you feel like Nick did a good job explaining how the new system works to a dependency, save the email as a reminder to yourself.
* **Quote directly from emails when others give praise** - The best feedback is [quotable feedback](http://andytroutman.com/articles/2013/01/17/how-to-give-good-feedback.html 'How to give good feedback'), but it's hard to come by. Look for it in emails, and make sure you highlight it before you drag the email into your folder or remembrance. 

Get into the habit of saving context for people, and your team will be blown away when you highlight something they did (and quote a peer none-the-less) from 9 months ago. You'll look like super manager, or perhaps [rain man](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GGQMRY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004GGQMRY&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwandytroutm-20 'Rain Man movie'), but either way they'll be impressed/terrified, and isn't that the point?

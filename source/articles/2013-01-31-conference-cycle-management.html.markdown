description: "Becoming a manager isn't about control. The moment you become a manager you lose direct control, but you gain a little authority, and the power of suggestion, and with some luck you can turn those into respect, which can take you far."

A little over a year ago I was considering a transition to management. At the time a colleague used an analogy of a bus to explain what it was a manager did, it went something like this: *"A manager is the bus driver, part of his job is to make sure the bus is pointed in the right direction, and part of it is to make sure the right people are on the bus"*. At the time, I felt like that seemed pretty good. I get to control where things are headed, and I've got this group of people who can make it happen once I get there. This analogy isn't half bad, except for one thing: we're not all on a bus, which powers itself and you're along for the ride, we're all on a conference cycle:

In order to get where we're going, EVERYONE needs to be peddling their asses off. We've got a heavy load to carry, and nobody is capable of getting there with a bunch of dead weight. As a manager, your job is to actually arrive at a destination - shipping a new product, making an existing one scale to meet customer demand, merging two systems together, etc... as a developer, my job was simply to peddle as fast as I could. Occasionally, my manager might tell me to hold on to the wheel in strait sections, but ultimately I had a pretty simple job. You have **direct** control of the outcome as a developer. If you stop peddling, the whole thing is going to grind to a halt, or at least slow down and everyone will give you dirty looks. 

When you become a manger however, you lose direct control of the outcomes. You're the lunatic in pink waiving at the camera with one hand on the wheel. This can be really tough when you're accustomed to getting immediate results from programming. You're tempted to try to regain that direct control you once had, to either program the solution yourself, or micromanage your team to do it how you want. You can do that, for a while at least, and it might even feel like things are going well. But eventually you'll realize that nobody is steering this god forsaken thing and everyone is just going in circles, and why did we ever decide to make this a team building exercise!

## Your secret weapon is the power of suggestion, and you power it with your tiny speck of authority
All hope isn't lost. You gain something subtle when you become a manager: the tiniest speck of authority ever. Don't let it go to your head, because with this authority you've got to get things rolling. You've got to use this tiny speck of authority as efficiently as possible to gently encourage everyone to start peddling. Gentle now, don't let them see the map, if they knew you signed them up for a 12 mile conference cycle tour they'd get off the bike right now and you'd never see them again.

You *can* use your authority to *tell* everyone to get on the damn bike and start peddling but if you do that, your authority goes up in a bright green flash like a meteor burning up in the atmosphere. It's done, it's gone, you spent it and you can't get it back, and **next** time you need some authority, guess what? It isn't there. 

A far more efficient use of authority is the power of suggestion. Giving people advice doesn't rub them the wrong way like telling them to do something does. The power of suggestion works, because in your pocket you've still got that tiny speck of authority. They're going to take your suggestion under advisement this time around because your name appears above theirs in the org chart, but that speck of authority is shrinking. You need a new plan fast.

You've still got 11 miles to go and suggestion will only take you so far. You need something stronger, you need some respect!

## Respect is management jet fuel
If you can earn some respect, you might just survive the next 11 miles of blissful conference cycling. Respect is really the only thing that keeps people working for you for the long run. Sure they'll start peddling because you exercised authority, some of them might even go it with you for the first few miles, but eventually they'll say this sucks and go work for the manager who took his team go-kart racing. The best way to earn respect is to actually get a win for the team. Show everyone that all this peddling is taking you somewhere. Peddle them to lunch - get a prototype running, ship a smaller feature, find an early adopter to use the product... whatever it takes to show the team that you didn't just steer them in circles. Give people a reason to suspect that you might be capable of getting them somewhere, and along the way you'll discover you've got a little respect. 

If you've earned some respect, and you don't waste it all on control, everyone will go places. Now you know what becoming a manager is really like (no you don't), good luck.

Let's talk about the incredibly important skill of giving feedback. Master this skill and it will pay dividends again and again. 

## Managers have no idea what you do all day

Here's the deal: if you have a good manager, they're extremely busy **not** paying attention to your every action. If you locked one of us in a room and forced us to name your accomplishments (Incidentally this is called "writing your performance review"), we'd get the big stuff down, and we'd of course remember any major snafus along the way. But the overall review would be vague, and a bit *hollow*. We could form the shape of the [golem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem "golem"), but without quality feedback from you and your peers, a manager doesn't have the words to bring it to life.

## Reviews are a weapon

I happen to really love the performance management side of my job. Done well, it helps the right people advance their career, which in turn advances my own career. There is a very direct and positive correlation to retaining and promoting top talent, and your own ability to succeed. If you're a manager, you need to take this part seriously because its how you build up a deep bench of talent that's willing to work for you in the future. You need to be able to write good reviews, and so you need to encourage your team to give good feedback. 

Here is an honest way to think of the review process: Your review is your manager's only weapon in the battle she's going to fight on your behalf. The battle is called stack ranking, and whether or not there's a formal process in place, rest assure that EVERYONE is getting compared against their peers, potential new hires, other consultants, other freelancers, and either being placed above or below them in the virtual opportunity line.

Because resources aren't limitless, we have to compare how people are doing in order to figure out who we should invest in, hire back for another contract, offer a new opportunity, etc. There will be a debate either publicly between managers, or in my own mind about how employees compare, and reviews are going to be used to make the argument for or against you. You need to make sure that your manager has as much data as possible to make a great argument for why you're the next in line for a good opportunity. I don't want to lose this kind of debate because there wasn't enough data to support you, and the feedback process is how you get me the data I need. 

## Feedback is the raw materials
So if a review is my weapon for battle, here is what I need from the feedback:

1. **Light** - Make your feedback focused and to the point, cut out the flowery pros, pick out the top qualities you want to highlight, and get right to the key concepts. I'm going to read **a lot** of feedback, so you'll forgive me if I gloss over a review that's 3 pages long. Don't exhaust me before I even get to the battlefield.
2. **Sharp** - Details are what sharpens a review of yourself or others. Specific examples, not anecdotal qualities, code samples not platitudes about how "clean" it is. Documents written, outcomes achieved, and disasters averted - these details make my review razor sharp and dangerous.
3. **Strong** - When giving feedback about yourself or another **don't couch your words**, it's not the time for modesty. I'll decide whether or not I agree with you, but tell me which of these quotes you'd rather see in your review: "Bob is *fairly good* at writing code. *Most times* his code is clean and *it's pretty clear* what his intent was." or this: "Bob writes good code, it's clean and his intent is clear". Make yourself quotable! It's hard to break down a really strong quote from a peer, keep my weapon strong.   
4. **True** - I don't mean "don't lie" (although, do that to), I mean that your review should include areas for improvement; it has to ring true and not sound like it was written by your mother (hi mom!). The best way to **lose** credibility in a review is to not include constructive feedback on where to improve. If your review tells me that you can't think of a single thing this person could do better, then I have trouble fully trusting your judgment on the positive as well. It's a terrible review to tell someone "you're doing good, but I have no idea how to make you better". Our weapon must represent truth and virtue, so include honest feedback on how to improve or get to the next level.

## Don't be afraid to rework the materials
In sword smithing, you [need the right raw materials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_swordsmithing#Elemental_composition "raw materials"), and so to with the performance review. I will absolutely return feedback if it doesn't help me build a good review. Hopefully the argument for writing good feedback has been made above, and you absolutely owe it to your team to help them develop this skill. If I get poor feedback and don't bother to help make it better, I'm not doing my job. Ask people to rework a sentence so it's quotable, add detail to a general endorsement, or to trim out fluff. Get your team to take this seriously, because you want to go into battle with the best <strike>weapon</strike> review possible.

title: "Get people to invest in what will make them remarkable"
description: "Sometimes improvement isn't about doing something differently, it's about doing more of what you're good at. Managers need to encourage people to be remarkable, and investing in your weakest talents won't get them there."

I'm wrapping up another review season with my team, it's a long, time consuming, and emotional process. Reviews at my current job follow a very simple structure: 

1. High-level overview of what was and wasn't accomplished
2. Strengths
3. Areas to improve

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about the "Areas to improve" section of the review and have come to the conclusion that most of us are getting it wrong, which can have a big impact on future performance reviews. What many managers are doing is to list whatever skill or principle the person is least efficient at, say that's what they should improve, and move on. There is an assumption there that's a bad one: whatever you're the worst in is what you need to focus on and do more of.

# Well rounded is frequently overrated.
For most of us, talent should be viewed as a set of [linked slider bars](http://keith-wood.name/linkedSliders.html). If you're going to put time and energy into one area, it's going to cost you some performance in another. Some people aren't running at full capacity, and at least for a little bit, they can improve performance in one area without compromising performance in another. Let's assume you've got a slider bar for every valued talent at your company. As a manager, is the strategy to make them all even? Make a really well rounded candidate? By encouraging people to focus on their weakest skills as areas to improve, we only succeed at making them unremarkable in every way. When I think about this candidate, the word that jump to my lips is "meh". Nobody (seriously, not a single person on the planet) is exceptional at everything all at once, and so a strategy of being "equally good" at all things means you're probably selling yourself short in an area you could have been exceptional in. By encouraging our people to invest in their least-developed skills, we're distracting them from becoming remarkable in something that matters more.

# Not investing in your strengths is silly: the effort isn't the same
People don't perform their poorest in something they're good at. A lack of interest usually leads to a lack of practice, which causes you to perform poor in one area or another. Encouraging others to improve the thing they're the least good at is an up hill battle all the way. And for what? So they can go from OK to more OK? Is it realistic for someone to become remarkable in something they're really good at, or the thing they're the worst at? I'd rather have the flawed remarkable person. Nobody says "play to your weaknesses" for a reason.

# The goal is to be acceptable in everything, remarkable in some
Let's take the sliders analogy from above, and break the range into 3 sections. The bottom section we will call "unacceptable". If you manage someone with one or more sliders is in this area, they run the risk of being fired if they don't improve. Next is the "acceptable" range, which is frequently quite large. Although the slider can move around in this range, and a good manager can say who's slider is closer to the top of the range, for the most part this means you're doing your job and if you plug away at it good things will eventually come your way. Finally, near the top we have the remarkable range. Remarkable is just that - it's a person worth talking about. A person who does acceptable at their job will usually have to seek out opportunities, but remarkable people have opportunities brought to them. Their skills are known to others and that makes them valuable. Being remarkable at something is clearly good for ones career, and increases their ability to attain professional goals. As a manager you want to create remarkable people, *that makes you remarkable*. 

Now look at the performance review and ask, what do we mark down for areas of improvement? Being unacceptable in some area has to go on the areas of improvement, it's a done deal. But what if the sliders are sprinkled throughout the acceptable range? The goal shouldn't be to take the two lowest sliders and move them further up. Instead, the goal is to find the sliders that are closest to the remarkable range and encourage people to push them over the line. **These** are the areas to improve, because they are the skills that will make one remarkable. 

If you're lucky enough to manage someone who is remarkable in a few areas and acceptable in all others, you have a decision to make: Do you encourage them to invest more in their most remarkable characteristics, or do you try to make them remarkable in others? I think this comes down to career goals. If someone is already doing what they want, and their most remarkable skills are a good match for the work, then I would encourage them to keep improving in those areas. If on the other hand I was managing someone with aspirations to grow into another role, or to be promoted to a more senior role, then the advice would probably involve growing one of their acceptable traits into something remarkable, even if it costs them to loose their edge in an existing skill. The reality is that different skills are valued for different jobs and levels. What got someone to a senior engineer position might not be what will get them to a senior manager, or distinguished engineer. You need to encourage people to invest in skills for the next level if that's where they want to be.

# Magnify people's talent
At the end of the day, a manager should be bringing out the best in his or her people. As painful and awkward as the review process is, it will be taken seriously by your team, and so there is a lot of responsibility to do it right. Simply telling people the areas you think they do the poorest in is a form of punting, and can lead to a situation where you're encouraging mediocrity. Instead, think about where the person can truly shine, and move them towards that reality. Making your people remarkable makes your job easier, encouraging them to invest in anything else is a bad plan for everyone.

I don't want to turn this into an "Agile methodology" blog, as this is one topic of Software management that's been *talked about to death*. However, if your team's answer to "what software development methodology do you use?" is "What?" and you wish for a better world, let's cover what really matters.

## Be wary of the person who cares a lot about process
General life advice here: Anyone who seems like a zealot on a topic isn't the right person to take advice from. I find that when people have **strong** convictions on a topic, they've usually decided to go ahead and ignore a class of problems that aren't compatible with their viewpoint. They've lost (or never had) scientific rigor, which is to say that they'll hold on to beliefs even when the data suggests we need a new hypothesis. 

So to does it go with process zealots. If you find somebody that's REALLY SUPER EXCITED ABOUT SCRUM (or Kanban, or Extreme Programming, or whatever), and seems to *have a rule for every god damn situation* I can't emphasize this enough: avoid this person at all cost. Software Development Methodologies (SDM) should be applied with a light touch. Be comfortable "breaking the rules" when they don't seem to work. Be careful about [quoting from the bible](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Software-Development-Scrum/dp/0130676349/ref=la_B001H6ODMC_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1357311522&sr=1-2 "Agile Software Development with Scrum") too much. If something isn't working, drop it like a sack of rocks and *move on*. 

## OK, so what are the good parts?
There are a hand full of basic principles that all agile practices start from, which is really the part that you should focus on. 

1. Break work down into small pieces that have a clear success criteria
2. Try to put some reasonable limits on how many of these pieces you work on at one time (1 per person is usually too many)
3. Check in with each other on a daily basis to make sure nobody is stuck/waiting to get work done
4. Achieve big results by getting really good at achieving a lot of little pieces of work, very quickly

That's about it. Seriously don't over think it, many would have you believe there's a bunch of magic somewhere in the process, I'm not convinced there is. 

## Just enough detail to get you started
Let me cover the 4 best parts in a little detail below, but honestly if you want to know *why* this process works, or you feel an itch to get lots more detail, there are tons of books on the subject (I've linked to one of them above), and thousands of clearly worded descriptions. I'm going to resist the temptation to retype all that here.

### Break down work into small pieces that have a clear success criteria
Don't go too far down the road before you check your map. There is rarely a clear route to success on a software project, so don't put in a lot of work only to discover you're solving the wrong problem, or you're not solving anything. Do something that reasonably informs the next step. 

The part about success criteria can't be over-stated: If you're the manager, or the lead developer, or just someone who cares you should ask yourself "how do we know when we're done" for every single piece of work you create. If people can't state what it means to be done succinctly, try to break down the task further. At some point you'll feel a little silly about this, but it's worth it. It's like stretching before you exercise, skip this step and risk injury to your productivity as you endlessly debate what "update mobile app" actually means. 

### Try to put some reasonable limits on how many of these pieces you work on at one time (1 per person is usually too many)
Two natural tendencies when programming software:
1. Working in isolation is preferred. It gives clear ownership of the problem and simplifies the debate about the best way to accomplish the task. 
2. Solving a problem 90% of the way is fun, but that last 10 percent is tedious and most would prefer to just move on.

These two totally reasonable inclinations makes it very easy to fall into a mode where everyone is working on multiple tasks alone, and all of them are about 90% done. If we're going to use previous work to inform the next steps, it sure would be nice to be able to complete work fast. In order to do this, many agile practices put some sort of limit to the amount of work that can be happening at a given point in time, just to hurry things along (Kanban limits the work in progress (WIP), SCRUM limits the work in a sprint which is a block of time, usually between 1-4 weeks, and XP suggests people pair up to do work). This mechanism usually drives the right outcome, but the manager's job is to make sure people are focused on getting work *done* not just doing a lot of work, so keeping people mindful of the goal is important. 

### Check in with each other on a daily basis to make sure nobody is stuck/waiting to get work done
Also known as the daily stand up, the goal here is brevity. Left to their own devices, many people will get stuck on a problem and dig in. This is an opportunity to uproot those issues and get people help whether they want it or not. If you've got someone idle who's not sure what to do next, this is also a good time to connect them with the next piece of work. The daily meeting is routine maintenance to make sure everyone is on the same page. It's invaluable for the manager who wants to stay on top of what's happening without micro-managing. 

### Achieve big results by getting really good at achieving a lot of little pieces of work, very quickly
If you don't believe this is true, doing the rest of the stuff is going to be difficult. You have to trust that taking small steps quickly is better than a gigantic leap forward. You have to believe that getting features delivered to customers fast gives you important data to deliver the next thing. You should feel uncomfortable trying to define an entire project up front, simple as that. 

That's it. If you're digging any deeper than this, take it easy on yourself, and go back to first principles.

Hiring talent is the most time consuming aspect of my job, but if you plot effort vs reward, it's the outlier in the upper right corner. It's incredibly important to [get the right people along for the ride](/articles/2013/01/31/conference-cycle-management.html "Conference Cycle Management"), which often times means convincing is in order. 

A very small portion of candidates will get to the point where you're interested in hiring them. Most will not get their resume in front of you, a good portion will never make it past the initial phone interview, and then finally another group will fail to get past the on-site interviews. If a candidate has made it this far, you and your team have literally spent **hours** working with this candidate. *The absolute worst time to loose a candidate is when you're making them an offer*. You have to get this part of the process right, or you're going to waste a lot of your team's time and effort. Wasting your team's time also costs you respect, which is just about the hardest thing to get back ever. Point being, you need to figure out how to get people on board, or you're gonna have a bad day. 

## The Sell Call

So your team has convened and everyone is extremely excited about the new candidate. The next step will be you or recruiting calling to tell the candidate that you're going to make them an offer. In most situations, the candidate is going to want to talk to you (the hiring manager) about the position. You see, because your company hires the best people you can find (you do do that, don't you?), and because this person is good enough to work with you, she's also good enough to work anywhere else. You're talking to a candidate that's got options, so now it's show time - you're going to sell the candidate on the position. Here's how. 

## Let's start with what not to talk about

* **Yourself.** - Nobody is joining a company so they can work for you, so get past your ego and start talking about the opportunity.

* **gimmicks or standard benefits.** - If your strategy involves talking about silly perks, or telling them that every new hire gets a free t-shirt you're doomed. Sure, benefits are important, but that's not what makes your position important. Why don't I go work somewhere else in your company? Why don't I go work for Google? Your company is not your team. Good candidates are looking for a purpose, and free lunch isn't it.

* **The technology.** - Wait, Enterprise Java Beans aren't the hot new technology? It's not 1994 anymore? Again, great candidates might have a preferred language, but [beware the developer who will only work in the latest technology](/articles/2013/01/24/rockstar-programmers-are-not-assholes.html). What you're doing with the tech is much more important than what the tech is. 

## Purpose and Opportunity

In your sell call, you need to convey what the purpose of your team is, why it's important, and what the opportunity will be for joining now. Perhaps two of the most famous examples of selling a candidate are Steve Job's [Do you really want to sell sugar water, or do you want to come with me and change the world?](http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2011/09/scully-on-jobs-sugar-water-legend.html), and Eric Schmidt's ["Get on a rocket ship."](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/05/24/sheryl-sandberg-to-harvard-biz-grads-find-a-rocket-ship/). If you dig into them a little deeper, there's some good lessons to take away:

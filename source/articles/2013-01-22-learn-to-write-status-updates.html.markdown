Regardless of role or seniority there is one form of written communication common to all others and it is the status update. Learn to communicate progress, problems, and wins upwards or suffer incalculable hours of micro-management, meetings, and well intentioned lectures. Let's break down how to make your status updates more difficult to ignore.

## 3 possible reactions to a status update

Think of most things in terms of the outcome. With a status update, you should be shooting for 1 of 3 possible reactions:

1. **The Good Job** - The most enjoyable piece of status to send out is the one intended to make someone say "good job". Valid uses are completion of project or milestone, or when a contentious decision is made. Because sending this status caries a positive reward, be mindful that you can become addicted and begin spamming people like a rat on a food pellet button. "Good Job" updates should be the least often sent form of status, but also the most satisfying. 
2. **How do we get past this?** - This is the most common form of status update, and is intended to engage somebody into asking how we're going to get past the current situation. Updates such as these are part of the cost of doing business, and shouldn't be viewed with dread. Shit happens, teams have different priorities, and sometimes it's unclear how to proceed. If you're sending out status that raises an issue to be solved, do yourself a favor and propose a solution. Managers hate being brought problems, but they **love** being brought solutions. 
3. **When will this be fixed?** - The most disappointing status to send is the one where the only reaction from your manager is to hold their forehead and ask *when are you going to have this fixed?*". This is reserved for when things have truly and utterly gone off the tracks. A customer is having a bad experience, a commitment isn't going to be met, or a goal isn't achievable. In these situations, take some career insurance and make sure that your update includes a date for resolution (or a date for a date in the worst case). You may be tempted to start talking about how this will never happen again, but don't. A status update isn't the right place for retrospective discussions, dedicated time to answer this later.

Before you begin writing up that email, figure out which of these responses you're trying to elicit and focus on the info that's important. A status update isn't a stenographer's transcript, leave stuff out.

## The structure of good status messaging: assume they only read the title. 
Here is a pro tip, particularly if you're a manager sending status up the chain: assume nobody reads anything but the title. Seriously. Email does not scale, and it's the first thing to go when people get extremely busy, so if you've got something important to say (and really, why are you sending out status if you don't?) better get it out in the title. 

Don't believe me? Prove it for yourself: send out status with a mundane title: "Project Wagon Wheel Status - MM/DD/YY" and inside the body, give out a simple action item - please respond yes or no kind of thing, and then see who does. Now, graph that over time. If you send out a weekly status, within a month you'll be getting 1 response from that guy who seemingly never has anything to do, but your actual boss will be suspiciously absent from the responders. By the way, who **is** that guy? He comes to all the meetings, but he just reads email on his laptop. Is he new? Did you miss the announcement?

Some people like to actually put key words in their email [ACTION REQUIRED], or INFORMATION ONLY, or what have you. This comes across a little bit anal retentive to me, and is the kind of thing that gets easily ignored with time. Do it if you must, but I'd prefer to reserve all caps for the "when will this be fixed" update messaging: PRODUCTION OUTAGE, INTERN ON FIRE, engineers are engaged with networking. That kind of thing. 

Instead, imagine you're passing someone in the hall and make whatever you'd say to them the title of your email: "Project Wagon Wheel status: blocked on a decision from Cowboy Corp. regarding spurs". If I read that I immediately know that this is a "How do we get past this?" status message. I can read the body for details, but I know what the next step is: get Cowboy Corp.'s attention and ask for a decision.

## Since you've said everything in the title, the body should be lean and to the point. 
Status updates are business communication, and as such, they don't need a lot of flowery prose. Don't thank everyone for their interest, they're paid to be interested. Don't recap the progress to date, you should capture that elsewhere so that "the guy from the meeting" has something to read over in his limitless spare time. 

Instead, the body of the status should contain the following:

1. **What needs to happen, who needs to be involved, and potential consequences** - Make this a todo list for the readers, be specific about who is to do what, or everyone will assume it's not for them. "Everyone must request their sheriff badges for project Wagon Wheel by 2/15 or they risk not going on the cattle drive."
2. **What outcomes were achieved since the last update, or what you said you would achieve but didn't** - not what was worked on. I have total faith that you're working on things, but I'm in constant fear that things aren't being completed. What got **done** since last we spoke? What did you say would be done by now that isn't?
3. **Links to more detailed info** - Offload the wordy stuff to a wiki page, word attachment, or website. Don't hit the reader with a wall of text or you'll scare them off. Keep the body terse. 

## Don't become the boy who cried wolf
My parting advice is to resist the temptation to send out status updates too often. You want people to say "Oh yeah how's that going?" without waiting so long that people say "what every happened to project Wagon Wheel? I guess we're not doing that anymore". A 2-3 week cadence feels like the sweet spot for many things, but use your judgment. If you send out "good job" status too often, people will be surprised when you send out the "when will this be fixed?" update a month from the project launch. People hate surprises, but that's a future topic of discussion. Good luck on your future updates, may they be read in full.
